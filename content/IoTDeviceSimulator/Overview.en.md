In this module you'll deploy and configure the AWS IoT Device Simulator to simulate the wind turbine sensors that will relay telemetry to AWS IoT Sitewise.

## Architecture Overview

The IoT Device Simulator solution helps customers test device integration and improve performance of their IoT backend services, via an intuitive web-based graphical user interface (GUI). The solution allows customers to create and simulate hundreds of connected devices, without having to configure and manage physical devices, or develop time-consuming scripts.

The diagram below presents the architecture you can automatically deploy using the solution's implementation guide and accompanying AWS CloudFormation template.

## Implementation Instructions

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Ensure you've completed the [setup guide][setup] before beginning
the workshop.

Each of the following sections provides an implementation overview and detailed, step-by-step instructions. The overview should provide enough context for you to complete the implementation if you're already familiar with the AWS Management Console or you want to explore the services yourself without following a walkthrough.
