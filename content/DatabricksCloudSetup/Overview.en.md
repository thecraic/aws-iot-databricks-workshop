In this module you'll set up a Databricks Cloud account and Workspace.

You'll sign up for a Databricks Cloud account (no credit card needed), and then create a Workspace in your AWS account where the Databricks processes will run.

You will need to verify your email address, note down the Databricks password and then run a QuickStart cloud formation template in your AWS account to complete the set up.
